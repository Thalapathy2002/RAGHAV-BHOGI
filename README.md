This is a simple implentation code for image sentiment analysis using convolutional neural networks. It is recommended to run the code under python3.5 in the 64 bit version. We created in spyder IDE not limited to specific platform but we didnâ€™t experimented on others except linuxmint. The project support several third party dependencies, we recommend to install them before running this code. The packages we used in image sentiment analysis are updated versions we recommend to install the latest versions for better results. it's also recommaded to use GPU for wise spending time on iterations.
